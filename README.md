# Will-I-Fail-Calculator
 The Will-I-Fail-Calculator calculates a student's final grade by asking the weight of some common grade categories. Some being quzzies, test, and assignments. If a student does not see a category to their liking, they will also be allowed to add one. Once all the categories  weight's have been established, the user will then add their grades to the appropriate category. When all grades have been submitted, the calculator will then average all the values of each category and add them together to output the student's current grade. Along with calculating their current grade, this calculator will also have an option to calculate the value they need to achieve their wanted grade. If the students decide to use this option, the progam will ask the weight of the final grade and along with the current grade it just calculated, will determine the value needed to achieve the student's wanted goal.
