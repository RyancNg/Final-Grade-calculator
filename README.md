# Will-I-Fail-Calculator
 The Will-I-Fail-Calculator calculates a student's final grade by asking the individual the weight and different categories that consist of their grade in a class. Once all the categories and their weights have been established, the user will then add their grades to the appropriate category. When all grades have been submitted, the calculator will then average all the values of each category and add them together to output the student's current grade. Along with calculating their current grade, this calculator will also have an option to calculate the value they need to achieve their wanted grade. If the students decide to use this option, the progam will ask the weight of the final grade and along with the current grade it just calculated, will determine the value needed to achieve the student's wanted goal.
